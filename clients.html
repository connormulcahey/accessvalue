				<h2>The Axcess Group Case Studies</h2>
				<a name="case-studies">
				</a>
				<p class="em">Since 2001, The Axcess Group has specialized in serving small business owners, high-net worth individuals, corporate executives, fiduciaries, and investors, and their legal, tax, audit, and transaction advisors. While each engagement is unique and afforded personalized attention, many of our clients return to us to address changing goals and objectives in their corporate or personal matters.</p>

				<h4>Sample Access Value engagements include:</h4>

				<h3>M&amp;A Valuation Services</h3>
				<p>Access Value provides valuation services for financial reporting to a financial services company that is expanding in the East Coast, Midwest, and Southeast. Our initial engagement related to the acquirer’s allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill. Subsequent valuation engagements have served the client for goodwill impairment tests under FASB’s ASC 805 and 350 (formerly SFAS 141(R) and 142).</p>

				<h3>Acquisition &amp; Divestitures Strategies</h3>
				<p>Access Value has provided one-off purchase price development for sellers, including regional energy conservation companies, and ongoing market intelligence and valuation services to buyers, including a diversified private equity firm and non-profit organization in the health care industry. Our financial analysts and valuation professionals research, identify, and prioritize acquisition targets across the U.S., conduct financial modeling and valuation analysis, and contribute on varying levels to transaction negotiations and due diligence, as required by our clients. </p>

				<h3>Buy/Sell Transactions, Equity Compensation<br>and Shareholder Disputes</h3>
				<p>Access Value has provided valuation services under the standards of fair market value and fair value for shareholder buyouts, equity compensation, and dissenting shareholder disputes. From the position of independent appraisers, our analysis involves a review of relevant terms of shareholder agreements; the company’s financial performance and potential changes due to specific triggering events; the valuation date and applicability of discounts for lack of control and lack of marketability; other relevant facts and circumstances identified by legal counsel, arbitrators, and reviewer of facts; as well as other factors. </p>

				<h3>ESOP Formation &amp; Administration</h3>
				<p>Access Value provides independent valuation services related to the formation, administration, and winding down of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). Our client engagements across the life stages of an ESOP serve ESOP fiduciaries by performing feasibility and sensitivity analysis, conducting annual valuations of ESOP shares, and developing fairness opinions on acquisition pricing.</p>

				<h3>Asset Protection</h3>
				<p>Access Value is retained by legal and tax advisors of high net worth individuals, for estate and corporate planning purposes, for the formation or management of family limited partnerships, asset management companies, and hedge funds and other investment companies. Underlying assets include cash and equivalents; privately held or publicly traded securities, and franchise businesses; residential, commercial, or industrial real estate; corporate jet credits; promissory notes and various other assets and liabilities.</p>

				<h3>Marital Dissolution</h3>
				<p>Access Value has experience in serving legal counsel, individual spouses or both spouses in valuing business interests for the division of marital assets. Sample engagements span various industries, from fractional interests in real estate holdings to internet start-ups, and from traditional manufacturing companies to high-end building and construction firms.</p>

				<h3>Estate Planning &amp; Settlement</h3>
				<p>An active area of Access Value’s valuation practice, particularly during economic downturns, is valuing interests and assets in family owned businesses. Sample engagements span various industries, from retail businesses in specialty apparel stores and restaurants to agriculture and farming businesses, and from business-to-business services in executive recruiting, printing and advertising to professional practices in primary care and veterinary medicine.</p>
