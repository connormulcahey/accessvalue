              Greetings Clients and Professional Colleagues,

              The 2012 tax season was a particularly busy one in business valuation, due to expectations for increased tax rates for businesses and wealthy individuals. As a result, businesses and individuals had heightened motivations for securing year-end business valuations on their privately held operating businesses, real estate holdings, and investment holding companies.

            <p>
              Greetings Clients and Professional Colleagues,

              Transaction activity took a double dip across most sectors in 2009 and 2011 – the result of a prolonged economic downturn, delayed revenue and earnings growth, and the lack of credit available for growth capital or acquisition financing. In current market conditions, buyers and sellers can benefit even more substantially from professional, independent appraisers, for purchase price development, valuation fairness opinions, and transaction negotiations.</p>

              Greetings Clients and Professional Colleagues,

              Many of Access Value’s valuation engagements in 2011 related to transactions between shareholders. The effects of the prolonged economic downturn, lack of credit available to small business owners, and decreased merger and acquisition activity in many sectors have given rise to amicable and adversarial intra-company transactions.
